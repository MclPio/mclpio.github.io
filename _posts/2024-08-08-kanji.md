# Learning Kanji!
In the past month, I have dedicated 1 hour each day to open up Anki and learn new characters. In this article I will share the resource I am using and maybe list a few favorite characters from the first 200.

## How To Start
I came across [r/LearnJapanese](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/wiki/index/resources/#wiki_study_plans) study guides and I choose [A Year To Learn Japanese](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10bRzVblKVOsQJjTc2PIi1Gbj_LrsJCkMkh0SutXCZdI). It has been well organized for me and dives into everything I can think of that would help. 

Using the guide, I have learned pronunciation and Kana which is a prerequisite to learning Kanji. After Kanji, what would be left is Grammar and Vocabulary before diving into language immersion such as reading, speaking, listening, writing.

## Anki
[Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) is a free open-source flashcard program. It uses spaced repetition and active recall testing to help a user memorize. It is compatible with many devices so you can Learn anywhere!

### How Does It Work With Kanji?
You start by reading the word, if you do not know it, you click show to learn about it. In the card there would be a story to help you remember what it stands for. You can also write your own stories. If you do know it, you have to try recalling what it looks like and then click show to confirm.

Included in my deck are also the pronunciations, but I find it challenging to remember some, but others like "Mizu" for water 水 are easy because of watching anime.

Finally, you would have 4 button to press, again, hard, good, easy which control when you will see the card again.

That is it, you just keep repeating this until you perfect your cards!

I enjoy it so far, it feels like a game and presents encouraging stats, including a heatmap like github to show your hard work!

## My Approach
My guide recommended 3 approaches:
1. Learn minimum amount and jump into Japanese content.
1. Learn a considerable amount to have an easier time later.
1. Somewhere in the middle.

I chose to learn a considerable amount of Kanji. I choose a [deck](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2009196675) that has about 2200 characters.

## My Current Favorites:
1. [貝](https://jisho.org/search/%23kanji%20%E8%B2%9D): Shellfish! It can also stand for currency, money and a head? At least that is what I understood and it depends if it is used with other characters.

1. [水](https://jisho.org/search/%E6%B0%B4%20%23kanji): Water. I like it because it is unique and it turns to 3 drops when used as a primitive.

1. [月](https://jisho.org/search/%23kanji%20%E6%9C%88): month, flesh, moon, part of body. I like it because it has many meanings. For example: 朋 means companion.

## Conclusion
Well, I better sleep now because I have more Kanji to do in the morning. I wonder will I make it till the end?
