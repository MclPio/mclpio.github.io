# Intro

Solving leetcode 146 LRU Cache. Using python `OrderedDict()` then implementing it via double linked list and python`Dict()`. I will also be making Ruby solutions.

## What is it?

Least Recently Used (LRU) Cache is a way to cache key value pair data, the idea is that you keep the most recent data in your cache while evicting least recently used data once your cache limit is exceeds its capacity.

## How it works?

Efficient implementations use:

- Double Linked List for O(1) insertion and removal
- Hash Map for O(1) lookup

Other possible implementations that I will go over involve using a Dictionary with indexing.

# Algorithm

Will draw stuff here so it is easy to understand

## Ordered Dict

## Double Linked List and Hash Map

# Implementation

### Python OrderedDict

### Python Dict and Double Linked List

### Ruby Hash table?
