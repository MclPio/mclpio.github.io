# Intro

Solving leetcode 146 LRU Cache. Using python `OrderedDict()` then implementing it via double linked list and python`Dict()`. I will also be making Ruby solutions.

## What is it?

Least Recently Used (LRU) Cache is a way to cache key value pair data, the idea is that you keep the most recent data in your cache while evicting least recently used data once your cache limit is exceeds its capacity.

## How it works?

Efficient implementations use:

- Double Linked List for O(1) insertion and removal
- Hash Map for O(1) lookup

Other possible implementations that I will go over involve using a Dictionary with indexing.

# Algorithm

Will draw stuff here so it is easy to understand

1. Initialize
    1. capacity, in our example it is 3
    1. cache, which is just an empty Dict {}
    1. left node(0,0) and right node(0,0)
        1. We will use the left node as the pointer to the least recently used while the right will be used for new insertions

1. Adding new nodes
    1. When we enter a new key
        1. We can see that when a new node is added, we rely on the right pointer to select a previous node and insert the new node in the middle
        1. We also update the Dictionary/cache with a key that corresponds to the Nodes we insert into the double linked list

    1. When our key already exists
        1. We remove the key from our double linked list
        1. We update our cache with the new value of the key, basically making a new Node object and overwriting it
        1. We insert our new key to our double linked list, of course using the right pointer so it is the most recently used node in our cacheÂ·

1. Adding nodes when we reach capacity
    1. We first insert the new node into our cache and double linked list, then we check if we are over capacity.
    1. If we are over capacity, we removed the LRU node which we can easily get from our left pointer.
    1. We use our left pointer to point to the value after the LRU node which leaves the LRU node out to be deleted later, perhaps by the garbage collector?
    1. Finally we removed the key that points to it from our cache

1. Using get
    1. When value exists in the cache
        1. We first remove the value from our double linked list; we use the node itself to then create pointers to the next and previous and use them to point at each other.
        1. Then we insert it again into the list so it is the latest used node. We use the right pointer to do that.
        1. Finally we return the value from the node, the Dict has a pointer to the node so that is easy.

    ![using get to return node value](/assets/img/2024-09-05-lru-cache-get.svg)

    1. When the value does not exist in the cache
        1. Our function would just return -1

# Implementation

### Python Dictionary and Double Linked List
This solution is from [neetcode](https://neetcode.io/problems/lru-cache), I did not understand at first why we needed to initialize two node pointers and connect them to each other. But I learned it is necessary for remove, and insert operations. What `prev`, `next`, `nxt` and not to mention the `left` and `right` pointers was confusing for me at first. What solved it is studying the algorithm and drawing it our step by step, there are probably leetcode easies made for inserting and removing nodes from a linked list.
```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, key, value):
        self.key = key
        self.value = value
        self.next = None
        self.prev = None

class LRUCache:
    def __init__(self, capacity: int):
        self.capacity = capacity
        self.cache = {}
        self.left = Node(0, 0)
        self.right = Node(0, 0)
        self.left.next = self.right
        self.right.prev = self.left

    def remove(self, node):
        prev = node.prev
        nxt = node.next
        prev.next = nxt
        nxt.prev = prev

    def insert(self, node):
        prev = self.right.prev
        nxt = self.right
        prev.next = nxt.prev = node
        node.next = nxt
        node.prev = prev

    def get(self, key: int) -> int:
        if key in self.cache:
            self.remove(self.cache[key])
            self.insert(self.cache[key])
            return self.cache[key].value
        return -1

    def put(self, key: int, value: int) -> None:
        if key in self.cache:
            self.remove(self.cache[key])
        self.cache[key] = Node(key, value)
        self.insert(self.cache[key])

        if len(self.cache) > self.capacity:
            lru = self.left.next
            self.remove(lru)
            del self.cache[lru.key]
```

### Python OrderedDict
Redis has a good [article](https://redis.io/glossary/lru-cache/
) which gave me the hint to try solving with [`OrderedDict`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.OrderedDict) fist.
```python
from collections import OrderedDict

class LRUCache:

    def __init__(self, capacity: int):
        self.capacity = capacity
        self.cache = OrderedDict()

    def get(self, key: int) -> int:
        if key not in self.cache:
            return -1
        self.cache.move_to_end(key, last=False)
        return self.cache[key]

    def put(self, key: int, value: int) -> None:
        if key in self.cache:
            self.cache[key] = value
            self.cache.move_to_end(key, last=False)
        else:
            if self.capacity == len(self.cache):
                self.cache.popitem()
                self.cache[key] = value
                self.cache.move_to_end(key, last=False)
            else:
                self.cache[key] = value
                self.cache.move_to_end(key, last=False)
```
