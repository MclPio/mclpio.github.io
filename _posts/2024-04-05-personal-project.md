# Intro
With the completion of my Ruby on Rails path, I have learned fundamental building blocks of building fullstack applications. On 2024-04-03, I went to a Toronto Ruby meetup where I had the chance to be at the office of an interesting Ruby company. 

Problem is, I do not think I am good enough to join their team, as they were recruiting for mid level developers with 3+ years of experience. Now I know people say to apply anyways, I will probably do so. **BUT** I can and should make myself much stronger by building complete software products that have users!

I want to set my self a roadmap to have easy goals to follow. So my plan would be to set a framework, either here or maybe on notion to launch *simple* products as fast as possible. 

I am thinking at the rate of 1 product a month... one of them ought to stick and if not I will at least have a portfolio of unique apps.

I will be using ["How to brainstorm great business ideas"](https://www.indiehackers.com/post/how-to-brainstorm-great-business-ideas-ab51c3d51c) by *Courtland Allen* as the basis of my business idea framework.

I will have to evaluate:
1. The problem I am solving and the market
2. How to reach customers
3. Monetization
4. My product

I will have to decide what tools to use to build the product. I will focus on using rails if possible, but if there are faster ways to achieve something, I will switch.

This is it for today, I will keep updating this post as I work.

Goodbye for now ðŸ‘‹
