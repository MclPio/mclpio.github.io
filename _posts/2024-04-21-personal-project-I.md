# Brief
Construct niche calendar app to present progress data on any subject.

## Problem
I personally like to use calendar.google.com to track my daily activity so I can manage and review how I spend my time on different subjects. I want to show the world that I am a very *vErY* cool and unique individual, I am a software developer, naturally I have a github account and different social media accounts.

## Solution
Make a product that automatically processes my google calendar daily data and input it into a database which then I can use for whatever I desire. Which solves one unique problem I have which is showing off my progress, just like that addictive github heatmap, I want to design something similar to it.

## Personal Comments
I have bias towards certain technologies and API's because they are simply *cool* to me. First, google has a calendar [API](https://developers.google.com/calendar/api/guides/overview) that I can and will have to use. Second, I want to add open ai API to my app as well just for the cool factor, I am biased towards AI and will be careful not to needlessly add it into my app because if I have to monetize, it **WILL** get complicated. However if there is a geniune unique feature that would differentiate the app with open ai API's, I would do so.

## Deadline
**2024-05-21**. A MONTH. Within a month I will build a rails app that is simple yet usable, I will take the fastest routes to implement my ideas.

## Conclusion
I will be summarizing my daily progress on the blog with titles "Personal Project I: Day X"
