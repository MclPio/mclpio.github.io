# Brief
Quick summary of todays 1.5 hour research session

## Product
I will build a goal tracking app that generates a heatmap which if filled would drop an image to collect.

## Monetization
I used gpt 3.5 to suggest monetization methods which was surprisingly insightful as I do not know much off the top of my head. I will keep this on hold as I need a working product first. A couple of cool ideas were freemium model, in app purchases, data monetization(not too keen on this), merch, subscription model, etc...


## Research
From today's session I believe I will end up using [google-api-ruby-client](https://github.com/googleapis/google-api-ruby-client). I set up a basic Rails app with postgreSQL.

## Problems
These are problems I would need to tackle
1. Set up user accounts for the site. Should I just use google Oauth and not have any other account types?
2. Generate heatmap. I think this would be a pretty neat algorithm I would have to make BUT if there is a library that converts an image to a heatmap square, I would utilize it.
3. Generate images. I am no artist, as cool as it would be to hire a professional to draw for me, I think I would leave this to AI, at least for the first few images.
4. Set up the google API itself.
5. Branding: landing page, logos, design
6. Security. protect site from easy attacks

## End
This is all I have for today, thanks for reading.
