Hello, I'm Michael, a software developer, building products from concept to production.

My background in Economics gives me a unique perspective on development. I'm driven to understand the 'why' behind the 'what', ensuring that the features I build are not just technically sound but also deliver real business value. I believe in end-to-end ownership: taking an idea, architecting a solution, and shipping a polished, production-ready application.

## Select Projects

Here are a few of the projects I've built and contributed to:

- **[stencil-ai.xyz](https://stencil-ai.xyz)**: A deployed LLM workflow platform for concurrent, real-time analysis. I built this from the ground up using Ruby on Rails, Hotwire, and deployed it with Kamal.
- **[Open Router Usage Tracker](https://rubygems.org/gems/open_router_usage_tracker)**: A Rails Engine for multi-provider LLM cost tracking and rate-limiting, downloaded over 400 times. You can find the source on [GitHub](https://github.com/MclPio/open_router_usage_tracker).
- **[Tunacode (Contribution)](https://github.com/MclPio/tunacode)**: Contributed a Python-based cost and usage tracking module to a CLI coding agent, implementing a modular, test-driven architecture.

## Technical Skills

My toolbox is always growing. Here are some of the technologies I'm proficient in:

- **Languages:** Ruby, JavaScript, Python, SQL, HTML, CSS
- **Backend:** Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, SolidQueue, Action Cable, Minitest, Pytest
- **Frontend:** React, Hotwire (Turbo/Stimulus), Jest, Tailwind CSS/DaisyUI
- **Infrastructure & DevOps:** Docker, Kamal, Git, AWS S3, Fly.io, RubyGems
